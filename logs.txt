    10/13/24 CEV- init project. Wrote Sprite, modSprite, Tile Layer class and methods. Need to optomize TileLayer.draw
    
    10/14/24 CEV- Camera working, need to fix hardcoded draw values for modSprite class and make this class into a new player class.
        Sprite class needs to be what modSprite is now. Still need to optomize TileLayer.draw
    
    10/18/24 CEV- Attempted to get tile map collisions working. Unsuccessful. Need to rework the modSprite class: 
        1. needs to be renamed player class.
        2. destination rect needs to be changed to a static rectangle positioned at center of screen.
        3. movement needs to be realted to camera offsets
        Collision logic needs to check collision layers against the center of screen less than half width and height of player in each direction
    
    10/19/24 CEV- Renamed modSprite to Player. Need to revisit the role of Sprite class and its relationship to Player and other sprites in game.
        will do this when I add enemies. Player destination rect is not separate from variables that move the camera. Specifically,
        Player now contains 2 Vector2s: One is a position that will place the player at a specified area of the map, the second is
        a velocity on X and Y axis that will effect the position of player on map. Position vector is fed to the camera and the
        tile map layers to effectively "move" the player around the map. Collision is detected but need to be handled. Added viewport
        object to facilitate cleaner code when positioning sprites in relaionship to center of window. This also
        scales the positioning of game drawing to any viewport dimension.
    10/20/24 CEV- Collision logic is rudimentary, but the player sprite stops when it collides with tiles on collision layer. Need to write
                    velocity as two vector2s each dealing with one axis and the two directions it can move. This needs to be done to fix a
                    bug causing the camera to continue moving when plyer collides. In this case, the player position Vector should not update in 1 
                    direction. Currently the position Vector in Player can only handle 2 movements: X and Y axis generally.
    10/24/24 CEV- Placed collision logic in its own method to make Update() more readable.
    10/26/24 CEV- Changed scope of classes and fields to closer resemble c# and OOP standards. Cleaned up and simplified field definitions.
    10/28/24 CEV- Implemented Timer, Projectile, and Fireball classes. Need to complete with projectile list. Created engine and world folders to organize classes. 
    10/31/24 CEV- Implementd World class for a more readable main class. Split the drect argument to the unit class into position and size, Rectangle is instantiated in
                    the constructor. This creates more readable code for sprite rotations. Rotations necessary to fire projectiles. Added Projectile list to world class
                    to maintain all fired projectiles in game and added player ability to shoot a fireball on click.
